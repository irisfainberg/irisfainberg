    <h1 a human to talk to</h1>
        <p>you swim across the room, looking for someone to talk to. steins and chairs float around you. as you reach the bar, you find a young man with long fiery red hair floating by you. you suspect this is the person who's dream you are in. you ask him if this is his pub, and he says it's not, he just lost his shirt in it. he asks if you can help find his shirt. you both breath under water fine, so you have no problem helping. you swim around looking for the shirt, as his beautiful red hair gently sways in the water. you open a cuppboard looking for the shirt, but accidentally knock a bucket of bar nuts that are now spreading across the water, somehow glissening like stars, they engulf you and the young man. you both stop to laugh at the ordeal and continue searching. the young man swims up high towards the light fixture, and excitedly declares his shirt is in the lightbulb. he breaks the bulb to grab it and the light goes out. the dreamer must have woken up, because you are zapped back to earth</p>
