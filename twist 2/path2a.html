        <p>you decide to taste the sand. at first you take a single grain and place it on the tip of your tongue. you can taste its sweetness. its so nice. you grab a handful and begin to chew. it tastes like an orange coconut cake that's been left in tea for 8 hours. weird but somehow super nice. you're hungry as hell, so you pig out on the orange sand, but the more you shovel in your mouth the harder it is to chew. at a certain point your jaw is locked, so you run down to the beautiful stream below to try and see your reflection. as you look at your reflection you realize: oh no! the purple moss has began sprouting through your teeth! no wonder it's hard to move your jaws! welp, you'd better get back to earth and find a dentist.</p>
