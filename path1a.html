    <h1>find the door</h1>
    <p>you swim across the room. steins and chairs float around you. being underwater is peaceful and stressful at the same time. you manage to find the door, and using some strength, you pull it open. a massive tsunami of the beautiful water rolls out the door with you in it, and you splash around, tumbling helplesly through a strange allyway. it's night out, but the sleek modern allyway is painted with white plaster, and glows warmly in the dark as it is lit by streetlights. long reeds line it's path. you grab on to a reed and hold on for dear life as the water rushes. finally the powerful stream subsides and you can breath. you stand up, soaked to the bone, but the warm summer night air dries you off. you continue to wander the allyway, now encountering pelicans that seem to get bigger and bigger. you ask a pelican where you are, and it squacks loudly at your face. the person who's dream you are exploring is awakend by the squack, and you are zapped back to earth</p>
